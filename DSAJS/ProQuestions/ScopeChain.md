### What is Scope and Scope Chain

-   This is one of question which asked by the interviewer often and the unprepared student ponders over closure, hoisting and other similar topic instead of a precise answer

-   Scope defines the accessiblity range for a variable/declaration. Scopes are of 3 types

    1. Global Scope
        - Global Scope in Brower is of the window and in a runtime is that of the global scope.
    2. Local Scope
    3. Block Scope {}

- Scope chain is a Chain of References. JavaScipt has a hunting mechanism for findint the varibles and it as followers.

- JavaScript will continue looking outwards until the Global Execution Context has been reached. You can go to an outer scope from an inner scope but not the reverse.
